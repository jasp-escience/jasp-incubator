# Suggested tasks

## Tackle an open issue
We maintain a [public list](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues) of known issues. You can browse it and, if you find something you might want to solve, go ahead. You can also use the issue to ask questions to us!

The list can be a bit overwhelming. Note that you can filter by label. We use one of the labels, `First project`, to tag [ideal issues for newcomers](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22First%20project%22).

## Contribute a module
JASP functionality is regularly enriched by modules developed by both professionals and volunteers. Is there something you'd like to see in JASP that is currently missing? You can seriously consider developing your own module.

If you already have the background, [this tutorial](https://github.com/PabRod/jasp-desktop/blob/tutorial/Docs/development/jasp-modules-tutorial.md) is the place to start building your own module.
