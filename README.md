# Welcome to JASP incubator

One of the best features of [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) is that it is an open source project. This means, among [other niceties](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/why-companies-win-by-investing-in-open-source-software-8c81bad92d79?source=collection_home_page----ab3660314556-----1-----------------------------------), that anyone can contribute to it.

If you are here, chances are that you are interested in doing so. But how? Well, you'll need two things:

1. To acquire or have acquired the required [background](./docs/background.md)
2. Take a look at our lists of suggested [tasks](./docs/tasks.md)

And of course, you can always contact us at: [info@jasp-stats.org](mailto:info@jasp-stats.org)
